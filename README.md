### Introduction
Without this **revolutionary website**, your commute is a **relentless torment**, an **unending battle** against the unpredictable. Imagine standing at the bus stop, **drenched by a torrential downpour**, your clothes clinging to your body like a second skin. The wind howls **mercilessly**, chilling you to the bone, while the minutes stretch into an **eternity**. Your attempts to shield yourself from the elements are **futile**, as you check your watch with increasing **desperation**, only to find the hours slipping away.

Each day, you are **ensnared in this storm of uncertainty**, your life disrupted by the **constant cycle** of missed buses and tardy arrivals. The mounting **stress** infiltrates every aspect of your existence, causing your **professional and personal life** to unravel. You stumble into work, **breathless and disheveled**, the stares of your colleagues burning into you with **silent judgment**.

The breaking point arrives when, during a crucial meeting, you appear **late, dripping wet and embarrassed**. The silence that follows is **heavy**, and the next day, you're summoned into the office for a dreaded conversation.

> **"That's it, we don't want you anymore"**

The weight of those words hangs over you like a **guillotine**. The realization dawns with **crushing clarity**: your job, your livelihood, hangs precariously by a **thread**.

The next day, a **crisp letter** arrives at your doorstep, embellished with a **flagship logo** that you once used.

That's it.

Life has no meaning anymore.

### The instructions

Just enter 5-digit bus stop code (what else?).

Note that this service is only available when there are actually buses operating in Singapore (obviously), so make sure you are running this program during roughly 7:00am - 12:00am (Singapore Standard Time, GMT+8).

It doesn't work... it's a static version
